# Ionic-Angular-Login-Flow

Sample project that shows how to build a dummy authentication flow logic for an Ionic 4 app using Angular.

This example is based on the example ["Building a Basic Ionic 4 Login Flow with Angular Router"](https://devdactic.com/ionic-4-login-angular/) that I modified to practice my skills. 

Technologies: Ionic, Angular, Angular-Router.

## Running

Before you go through this example, you should have at least a basic understanding of Ionic concepts. You must also already have Ionic installed on your machine.

* Test in localhost:

To run it, cd into `ionic-angular-login-flow` and run:

```bash
npm install
ionic serve
```

## Requirements

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started#cli)
